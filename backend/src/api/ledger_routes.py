"""Read routes for the economy ledger (SimpleFactions snapshots).

`ledger` is the economy series; `chronicle` remains the map timelapse — see
`src/scripts/ledger/__init__.py` for why the two names exist side by side.

Everything here is a plain `def`, not `async def`: every body is synchronous
SQLite plus JSON encoding, so FastAPI runs it in the threadpool instead of
blocking the event loop (same reasoning as `chronicle_routes.get_chronicle_index`).

Shapes are frozen against `frontend/app/lib/map/ledgerData.ts`. The series
responses are **columnar** — one shared `days[]` axis and one array per field —
because a row-per-day-per-faction shape repeats every key name once per day and
costs several megabytes over a two-year range. `null` at index `i` means the
faction (or field) was absent from that day, which is deliberately distinct
from `0`.

**No server-side deltas.** `net_income` / `inflation_delta` / `guild_income` are
full-day projections from the game and are served as their own series; a stock
delta is the client's to compute, and mixing the two would silently present a
projection as an observed change.
