"""One exclusive, cross-process lock per (map, subsystem) tree.

`atomic._day_lock` serialises captures of the same (map, day) *inside this
process*, which is all a capture ever needed. The destructive ops need more:
`chronicle/wipe.py` archives index rows, renames the day tree aside and then
deletes the rows, and a capture landing between any two of those steps writes a
live row (or a day directory) that the next step orphans or deletes with no
archive copy. A `threading.Lock` cannot see the second uvicorn worker, and the
CLI (`python -m src.scripts.chronicle.wipe`) is a different process entirely.

Why a lock file and not SQLite `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`: `src/skins/db.py` is one
database shared by every feature in the app, and SQLite's write lock is
database-wide, not table-wide. Holding it for the whole of a wipe — a directory
rename over potentially years of day folders — would block every unrelated
writer (roster, skins, wardrobe) for that entire time. A byte-range lock on a
file next to the tree costs nothing anyone else pays for, and `msvcrt` /
`fcntl` cover the two platforms this runs on.

The lock is *reentrant per thread*: `reindex_map` holds it across its whole loop
while each `promote_day` inside takes it again, and the staff routes take it
before calling `perform_wipe`, which takes it too. Each entry pairs a
`threading.RLock` (which excludes other threads here and gives the reentrancy)
with the OS lock taken once at depth 0 (which excludes other processes).
