"""Generate a spoof season of ledger (economy) snapshots and ingest them.

Builds a synthetic SimpleFactions "chronicle" upload season — the economy
snapshot mode described in `docs/map/ledger.md` — and feeds every snapshot
through the real ingest path (`ledger.schema.normalize_snapshot` +
`ledger.ingest.store_raw` + `ledger.ingest.promote_day`) so the raw/daily
storage layout, canonical-daily promotion, faction registry, and SQLite index
are all genuinely exercised, the same way a real 300s-interval upload season
would build them up. Nothing is hand-written into the database.

The season is deliberately not "clean" test data: it scripts the handful of
behaviours that are easy to get subtly wrong and hard to eyeball from a
production dump —

* wealth is a multi-component stock (bank / mining nodes / guild expansions /
  trade ventures) that drifts and occasionally shocks, not one line scaled up
* one faction's prestige visibly falls purely because rivals got richer while
  its own wealth sits flat (`wealthShare`, per the ledger doc's second trap)
* `rank_up_at` / `rank_down_at` move over the season and get crossed in both
  directions
* `net_income` / `inflation_delta` / `guild_income` are scripted as
  independent full-day projections that disagree with the observed
  day-over-day stock change (the ledger doc's third trap)
* one faction is deleted mid-season (`complete: true`, absent afterwards) and
  its id is later reused by a new faction with a different `founded_at`, so
  `(id, founded_at)` identity has two distinct rows to keep apart
* one full UTC day has no snapshots at all (a gap) and one has every snapshot
  `complete: false` (a degraded day), to exercise the null-gap and
  fallback-canonical paths

By default snapshots are ingested directly (no server needed). `--post` sends
them over HTTP to `POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/{map}/data/upload/chronicle`
instead, to exercise the route end to end against a running dev server.

Faction identity: by default (`--ids-from-map`, which is implied unless
`--synthetic-ids` is given) the faction ids/names/colours are the *real*
nation ids captured in the target map's own chronicle history — the union
of every nation id appearing in that map's `chronicle/{day}/nation.json.gz`
across the season window, read via `chronicle.store`. This is what lets the
timelapse studio's ledger chart panel resolve a focused nation
(`useLedgerSeries.resolveFactionKey`, which matches on the map's nation id)
against seeded ledger data: matching against invented `faction_0..faction_N`
ids never resolves, because those ids never appear in any `nation.json`.
`--factions N` then means "use up to N of the real nations that were
actually captured"; if the map has fewer than that in the window, all of
them are used and a warning is printed. If the map has none captured at
all, the run fails with a message pointing at `--synthetic-ids`, which
restores the old invented-id behaviour (`faction_0..faction_N` with
generated names/colours) for maps with no chronicle history yet (e.g. a
fresh `dev` map).
