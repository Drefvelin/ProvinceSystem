"""Backing-up wipe of one map's ledger: `python -m src.scripts.ledger.wipe --map dev`.

Nothing here deletes snapshot bytes — the ledger tree is renamed aside, exactly
like `scripts/chronicle/wipe.py` moves the chronicle tree.

Unlike the chronicle there is no `*_archive` table. The chronicle's index rows
*are* the only record of a day's manifest, so they have to be copied before they
go; every ledger row is derivable from `daily/{day}.json.gz`, which the backup
directory still holds, and `reindex.py --map X` rebuilds all four tables from it.
Four archive tables would be four more things to keep in step for no recovery
the backup does not already give.
