"""Undo one backing-up chronicle wipe: put the day folders and index rows back.

The wipe is deliberately non-destructive — day directories are renamed to
`chronicle.bak.<stamp>` and index rows are copied into
`map_chronicle_snapshots_archive` before they leave the live table — so a
restore is a *move back*, not a rebuild. Nothing in this module deletes
snapshot bytes or archive rows either: the worst outcome of a half-finished
restore is that some days are back and some are still in the backup, which the
same call fixes when it is retried.

    is removed, and only if it is genuinely empty.
