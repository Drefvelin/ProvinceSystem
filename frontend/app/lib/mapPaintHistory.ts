/**
 * Undo/redo for the paint layer. Shapes are immutable, so a snapshot is just an
 * array copy — cheap, and structurally shared with the previous snapshot.
 *
 * Granularity is one entry per completed *gesture* (stroke, stamp, erase drag,
 * move), never per intermediate pointer sample. In-progress geometry lives in
 * a separate draft outside `present` so the live preview never enters history.
