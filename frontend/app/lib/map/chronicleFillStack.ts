/**
 * Compositing several province -> colour tables down to the one table
 * `paintChronicleFrame` walks.
 *
 * The studio has exactly one fill canvas per frame, and that is deliberate: a
 * frame is an `ImageBitmap` held in memory for the whole playback, so a second
 * fill canvas per day would double what a 79-frame build costs at the ceiling
 * `CHRONICLE_MEMORY_CEILING_BYTES` already sets. It would also have to be
 * threaded through `runChronicleBuild`, `disposeChronicleFrames`, the playback
 * draw and the GIF compositor, and a layer that shows on screen but is missing
 * from the export is the exact bug that split path invites.
 *
 * So the extra fill layers are composited *per province id* instead of per
 * pixel. There are hundreds of provinces and millions of pixels, so blending
 * here is free next to blending in the paint pass, and the result is a single
 * ordinary LUT that every existing caller already knows how to draw.
 *
 * Source-over, in the order given, lowest layer first. A layer that wants to
 * let the one beneath it show through says so with its own alpha byte — which
 * is why `buildTradeLeagueColorLut` and `buildProsperityColorLut` pack a
 * partial alpha and `buildNationColorLut` packs 255. Nothing here consults a
 * toggle: the caller passes only the layers that are on, so the stack for a
 * given set of toggles is decided in one place and cannot drift between the
 * compose preview and the build.

 * the general formula: with `as === 0` the colour terms are all multiplied by
