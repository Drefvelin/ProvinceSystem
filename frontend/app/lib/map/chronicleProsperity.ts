 * province first turns green looks exactly like the day the whole map is rich:
 * the growth a timelapse exists to show is precisely what the rescale divides
 * out. With a fixed domain a colour means the same number on every frame, so a
 * province warming from day to day is warming on screen.
 *
 * The cost of a fixed domain is that it has to be chosen. On main's 806
 * provinces a stored day runs 0 to ~40 with a long tail — 134 provinces above
 * zero, most of them in single digits, one at 39.3 — so a linear 0..40 would
 * flatten almost the entire map onto the bottom stop. 100 with the log
 * compression below leaves headroom for a map that grows into it while still
 * spreading today's values over most of the ramp, and anything above it clamps
