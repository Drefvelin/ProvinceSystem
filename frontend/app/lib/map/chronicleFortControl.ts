/**
 * Fort zones of control for one stored day, rebuilt from the province ids the
 * day itself recorded.
 *
 * The live map shows a ZoC as a server-rendered `/{map}/zoc/{fort}.png`, and
 * the chronicle deliberately cannot use those: they are regenerated from
 * *today's* forts, so `MapCanvas` blocks them for a stored day and
 * `chronicle_routes` records the same limitation. The captured
 * `zoc_overlays` file is no help either — it holds a bounding box per fort and
 * nothing about the shape inside it.
 *
 * What the day *does* carry is `forts[].zoc_provinces`, the exact list
 * `zocgen.build_zoc_overlay_image` masks the hatch against. Rebuilding from
 * that against the same province id grid gives the historically correct zone
 * for the day being shown, not today's, and costs no source the `forts` toggle
 * was not already fetching.
 *
 * The hatch is `zocgen`'s own: an 80-pixel tile at the 6400-wide source, red
 * where `(x + y) % 80 < 32` and transparent elsewhere. The shipped
 * `assets/map/zoc_hatch.png` is pixel-for-pixel that formula, so there is one
 * pattern to match rather than two.
 *
 * Pure over typed arrays, like the other chronicle paint modules.
