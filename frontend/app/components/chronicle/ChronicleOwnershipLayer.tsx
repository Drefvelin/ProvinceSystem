 * are PNGs under `/{map}/regions/{mode}/...`, regenerated from *today's* data
 * with no per-day variant. A stored day therefore has to paint them itself, or
 * opening a date in 2025 would show 2026's borders.
 *
 * Both canvases are painted from the quarter-scale province id grid: 1600x1600
 * against a 6400x6400 map, so a border can land up to 4 map pixels from where
 * the full-resolution PNG puts it. That is a deliberate 16x memory trade, not
 * an oversight — the full-res grid would make each of these canvases a 164 MB
 * `ImageData` (328 MB for the pair, ~500 MB once the pick canvas joins them),
 * against ~10 MB each here. At the zoom levels the viewer supports the
 * difference is under a pixel on screen.
